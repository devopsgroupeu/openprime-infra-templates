# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## 🤝 Our Pledge

As members, contributors, and leaders of this project, we pledge to make participation a harassment-free experience for everyone. We are committed to fostering an open, welcoming, and inclusive environment where all voices are respected. 💬❤️

## 📏 Our Standards

We expect everyone to use welcoming and inclusive language, respect differing viewpoints, and accept constructive criticism graciously. Positive interactions help build a supportive community for collaboration and learning.

Unacceptable behaviors include trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, harassment in any form (public or private), and sharing private information without consent. 🚫 Such behavior undermines our community and will not be tolerated.

## 🛠️ Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying these standards and enforcing them fairly and consistently. This includes addressing violations, mediating conflicts, and ensuring a safe space for all participants. ⚖️

## 🌐 Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including GitHub repositories, issue trackers, discussion forums, chat channels, and any public interactions where an individual is representing the project. 🏷️

## 📩 Enforcement

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to the maintainers at [security@devopsgroup.sk]. Reports will be treated with confidentiality and seriousness. 🔒
