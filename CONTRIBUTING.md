# CONTRIBUTING

## 📌 Why Read This?

Following these guidelines helps ensure your time and ours is well respected. Clear, thoughtful contributions improve response time, reduce confusion, and increase the likelihood of your changes being merged.

## 🤝 What You Can Contribute

We welcome contributions of all kinds:

* Code (new features or bug fixes)
* Bug reports or feature requests
* Documentation improvements
* Docker or CI improvements

## 🙅‍♂️ What We're Not Looking For

Please avoid:

* Feature suggestions that lack context or a use case
* Support questions (use Discussions or Stack Overflow instead)
* Unreviewed PRs touching core design without discussion

If unsure, open a *GitHub Issue* to talk first.

## 🔒 Code of Conduct

Please review our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We're committed to fostering a safe, inclusive environment for everyone.

## 🚀 Your First Contribution

### 🛠 Getting Started

* Fork the repo and clone it locally
* Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
* Install dependencies (see README.md for instructions)
* Make your changes and test them
* Push your branch and open a PR

If your change is *non-trivial*, open an issue first so we can discuss.

### 🔁 Obvious Fix Policy

You don't need to open an issue for:

* Fixing typos or formatting
* Comment updates
* Minor `README` changes
* `.gitignore` tweaks

Just go ahead and **open a pull request**.

### 🐛 Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? Please include:

* Steps to reproduce
* Expected vs actual behavior
* Environment details (OS, runtime version)
* Any error messages or logs

Security issue?
Please do **NOT open a public issue** — email us at [security@devopsgroup.sk].

### 💡 Suggesting Features

We encourage thoughtful suggestions! Please:

* Explain why the feature is needed
* Provide a possible implementation approach
* Mention alternatives considered (if any)

Open a GitHub Issue with **[Feature]** in the title if you'd like feedback before coding.

### 🔍 Code Review Process

* A maintainer will review your PR within 7 days
* We may ask for changes before merging
* Keep commits clean and focused (squash if needed)
* Stay responsive — stale PRs may be closed after 2 weeks of inactivity

### 🌐 Community
